## todolist(bugfix)
- ~~if slice can be a scalar x and equal to (1: x + 1), there will be conflict in argtable~~
- more specific type cast functions(char, int, long long)
- ~~read statement undefined device~~
- ~~minus 1 and negative 1 conflict(modify definition in .l)~~
- either an `interface` or **forward declaraion of return value** is need when calling functions in fortran, so must remove all `interface` and ~~forward declaraion of function return value~~ in generated code in order to avoid repeat definition.
- ~~error message line info is always 0~~
- ~~handle error when can't find declaration of the variable listed in function paramtable~~
- ~~handle with empty line~~
- ~~split keyvalue rules from paramtable rules, may cause bugs~~
- ~~_type_kind rules and type cast function call conflict~~
- ~~solve `paramtable : exp`, `argtable : exp` conflict by merging argtable to paramtable~~
	~~1. merge `argtable` and `dimen_slice` to paramtable~~
	~~2. only change reduce rules~~
- ~~`printf` array~~
- ~~fixed length character initialize with shorter characters~~
- global attr and node attr
- ~~add arraybuilder rule to exp rules~~
- use `make_str_list` function replace some ugly code
